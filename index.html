    <h1>"Indifference" Pearl Jam</h1>
    <p>I will light the match this morning <br>
    So I won't be alone <br>
    Watch as she lies silent <br>
    For soon that will be gone <br>
    Oh, I will stand arms outstretched <br>
    Pretend I'm free to roam <br>
    Oh, I will make my way throught <br>
    One more day in hell..</p>
    
    <p>How much difference does it make? 4x</p>
    
    <p>I will hold the candle <br>
    'Til it burns up my arm <br>
    Oh, I'll keep takin' punches <br>
    Until their will grows tired <br>
    Oh, I will stare the sun down <br>
    Until my eyes go blind <br>
    I won't change direction <br>
    And I won't change my mind</p>

    <p>How much difference does it make? 2x</p>
